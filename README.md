# Python Initiation

This code consists of two sripts, one that processes the financial records from a company and another one that processes poll data. 

## PyBank

The financial records are in the Resources folder, inside burget_data.csv. The file is composed of two columns, one for the data (month & year) and the other one for the change in balance. The script displays information such as: total months, total balance, average change, greatest increase in profits, and greatest decrease in profits.
This information is displayed as a regular output and into a .csv file inside the Analysis folder.

## PyPoll

This script runs through a set of poll data in the file election_data.csv. The data set is made of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. The script calculates: the total number of votes, the votes for each candidate and its percentage, and the winner. 
The results are displayed as a regular output and into a .csv file inside the Analysis folder.
